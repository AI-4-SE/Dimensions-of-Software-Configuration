# Questionnaire

## General

What do you do professionally in your job?

In which domain are you working primarily?

What is your role in software development?

What is the amount of software engineering and programming in your daily job?

How many years of experience do you have in software engineering?

Since when do you work at your current company?

Since when do you work in your current position?

Which tools and frameworks do you use usually?

## Configuration

How do you define configuration?

When do you configure software?

To what extent are domain-specific and technical configuration important for
your daily work?

Are there interactions between domain-specific and technical configuration?

Are you usually configuring a monolithic system?

To what extent do (a) tools, (b) frameworks/libraries, and (c) infrastructure
have to be configured? Are there interactions between those configurations?

How important is configuration for software engineering?

- Are there differences between the phases of the software lifecycle?
- Did your studies prepare you for that?
- Should configuration be a part of computer science programs?

## Working with configuration

How are configurations managed and documented at your company?

- What is the biggest advantage of this method?
- What is the biggest disadvantage of this method?
- Are there special tools for this?

How do you communicate configurations in your team?

- What is the biggest advantage of this method?
- What is the biggest disadvantage of this method?

Do configurations get reviewed during code reviews? If yes, how?

Is the software you implement configurable? If yes, which criteria and at which
point do you plan or implement configuration options?

How much effort do you put in implementing configuration options?

How much time do you spend for configuration during development?

How much work is the initial configuration for tools, frameworks, and
infrastructure?

How much time do you spend in case of version changes or other
configuration-dependent changes?

What is the biggest factor for the workload for configuration?

Do you use configuration to tune non-functional properties, e.g. performance?

## Configuration errors

Does the configuration of systems, tools, infrastructure, and frameworks pose
any problems for you?

What are the most difficult problems in your opinion? Please describe the
problems that take the most time. Why those?

What are the problems and causes for difficulties during configuration?

What is a tool or framework that is difficult to configure? Why?

Is the configuration of interaction tools/frameworks problematic? If yes, what
are the challenges in comparison to independent tools/frameworks?

What are configuration errors and how are they different from regular bugs?

What are the most common effects of configuration errors?

Did you experience configuration errors? If yes, can you recapitulate a notable
one?

How often do configuration errors occur during your work?

When do configuration errors occur typically?

Are there differences between configuration errors of domain-specific and
technical configurations (e.g. for the above questions)?

How do you usually proceed to find and fix configuration errors?

What are your strategies to prevent configuration errors?

## Improvements

What do you expect from a good documentation regarding configuration?

Can you give an example for good/bad documentation of configuration options?
What are the reasons?

What improvements would you like to see regarding configuration of software
systems, frameworks, tools, infrastructure, and their interactions?

- What would help you to identify configuration errors faster?
- What would help you to fix configuration errors faster?
- What would help you to prevent configuration errors more effectively?
